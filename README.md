- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Steph(anie) Abegg. I am a data analyst with a strong foundation in math and a knack for making complex ideas make sense. I have taught university-level mathâ€”mostly calculusâ€”which really sharpened my ability to communicate clearly and break down tough concepts. My path has included a few masterâ€™s degrees in technical fields, time in the classroom, and a couple years working at a startup where I wore a lot of hats and tackled real-world data problems. I recently completed a data analytics bootcamp to strengthen my skills with tools like Python, SQL, and Tableau. I love digging into data, spotting patterns, and turning information into insights people can actually use. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data, math, and climbing big rocks.
